This game is an ocean-themed shooting game。

In this game, you have a fish that can launch attacks, and you need to use it to destroy all the starfish and shells to
get score and get into the next level, and at the meantime to avoid their impacts to avoid receiving damage.

At the beginning of the game, large shells and starfish are randomly generated on the page:
(1) You can fire by pressing 'space' bar, and use 'up' arrow to trust, 'down' arrow to doge, 'left' and 'right' arrow to
turn your firing directions. When you are thrusting, your fish will get bigger, and when you are doging, your fish will get smaller.
(2) Each large shell can be hit by a colorful bubble shot by your fish and splits into several medium-sized shells,
and each medium-sized shell is hit and splits into small shells, which can eventually be eliminated completely.
(3) Each large starfish, when hit, will split into small starfish that can be completely destroyed, and you will be rewarded
for destroying the small starfish by generating nuke minnow that can accumulate nuclear explosions when you eat it!

The page also spawns a number of minnows at regular intervals, including yellow nuke minnows, pink shield minnows, and
green multi-directional attack minnows, which you'll need to eat in order to gain the appropriate skills.
(1) Orange nuke minnows：If you eat a orange minnow, you'll gain the ability to launch a nuke, follow the instructions on
the page and press the N button, you'll be able to launch a nuke that can get progressively bigger!

(2) Pink shield minnows：If you eat a pink minnow, you will get a protection shield, you will be automatically fitted with
a pink shield and turn pink (the pink state is the protection status of the fish, the fish will also be in this state at the
beginning of each level), at this time when you hit the starfishes or shells you will not receive damage!

(3) Green multi-directional attack minnows：If you eat a small green fish, you will get the ability to attack in multiple
directions, a prompt will appear on the page, after this when you fire, you will send out bubbles in three directions:
left front, front and right front, but note that you can't turn on the multi-directional attack ability in Protected Status!

You can see how much meter you have left for each of the above skills at the bottom right of the screen.

Besides:
(1) Your bubble will explode when it disappears.
(2) The page will spawn a shark at regular intervals and it will chase your fish, you need to avoid it!
(3) When you successfully shoot starfish and shells, you'll earn score, and you can see your score at the top left of your screnn.
(4) When your fish is hit by a starfish, shell or shark, you will lose one life, when you run out of lives, it's game over.
Initially you have a total of 5 lives. You can see your remaining lives at the bottom right of your screen.
(5) When all the starfish and shells on the page have been eliminated, you pass the level and move on to the next one,
with the initial number of starfish and shells increasing as the number of levels increases. You can see your current
level at the top left of your screen.
